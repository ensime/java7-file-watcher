[![Build Status](http://fommil.com/api/badges/ensime/java7-file-watcher/status.svg)](http://fommil.com/ensime/java7-file-watcher)

A Java 7 asynchronous file watcher, in its own repository so that it can use Java 7 APIs (`ensime-server` uses JDK6).

This will eventually be merged into `ensime-server`.

The main code and artefact is licensed under the Apache 2.0, but the tests (which are not published on sonatype or maven central) are derived from ensime-server and are licensed under the GPLv3. Bare this in mind if you plan on copying and pasting this code into your project. A `LICENSE` file resides in each source root.
